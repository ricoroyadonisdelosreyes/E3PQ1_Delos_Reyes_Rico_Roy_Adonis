<b>First/Second Year</b><br>
<p>
I am a transfer student to this college. Since I graduated my vocational course last 2008, i need to take both<br>
the first year and second subjects that didn't credit from my old college. Taking two shift was quite hard but <br>
I finish all of it since these are minor subject and my group helped me a lot.</p><br>

<b>Third Year First Sem</b><br>
<p>This year and sem give me a regular schedule and i thought studying will be easy but the pandemic came. Because<br>
I and my group don't have a stable resourse to use like laptop, we have a hard time finishing project.</p><br>

<b>Third Year Second Sem</b><br>
<p> This sem will be harder that before because of the upcoming thesis and projects. I and my group need to focus study.</p><br>

<b>Fourth Year</b><br>
<p>I will study harder this time to graduate.</p><br>

<b>After Graduate</b><br>
<p>I will find a job that suit to my course, and that time i will not holding vocational course diploma but a bachelor degree.<br>
I will find a job that will improve my skill in programming or in any field related jobs.</p><br>
